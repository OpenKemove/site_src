# Open Kemove

**Open Kemove** is an alternative firmware for Kemove Keyboards. It is based on [QMK](https://qmk.fm/), a powerful open source keyboard firmware that gives you many customization options, such as user-defined macros, per key modifications and layered typing. 

## Development status

Currently, Open Kemove only supports the `Snowfox` keyboard, but you are welcome to request support for other Kemove models, like the `Shadow` and `Dierya DK61`.

This project is still under heavy development and in its early stages.
