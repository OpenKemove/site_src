# Open Kemove

This is an alternative firmware for Kemove Keyboards.

Currently only the `Snowfox` is supported. You are welcome to request support
for other boards.

## Status
This project is still under heavy development and in its early stages. I would recommend to always have a backup keyboard if you are going to participate in the project. (i.e. if something arises you still have a second way to input keystrokes for long enough that you can either restore to the original firmware or find a solution).

> Technically an on screen keyboard would work but I would not recommend :D

## Why port QMK
[QMK](https://qmk.fm/) is a powerful open source keyboard firmware used by
many open source keyboards that are on the market today. It is most famous
for its appearance in the Plank and ErgoDox EZ keyboards.
